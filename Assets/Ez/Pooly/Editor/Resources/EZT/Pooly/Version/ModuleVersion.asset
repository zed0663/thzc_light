  releaseNotes: "IMPORTANT WARNING: Release 2.0 is incompatible with previous versions
    of ALL Ez assets! Before updating, you MUST manually delete the Plugins/Ez folder
    to prevent compilation errors!\r\nPLEASE BACKUP PROJECTS BEFORE UPDATING!!!\r\n\r\nRemade
    the asset\u2019s UI from scratch for better performance and modern look\r\nDifferent
    UI skins for Unity Personal and Professional\r\n\r\nIntroduction of pooling statistics\r\n
    - Provide a quick and simple way to oversee prefab usage\r\n - Customizable warning
    levels that underline under or over-usage of prefabs\r\n - Statistics are collected
    per pool & per prefab. It is easy to distinguish prefab usage in different scenes\r\n
    - Statistics are collected ONLY in inspector (they are never included in builds)
    thus there is no impact on performance\r\n \r\nPooly Main Pool and Pool Extension\r\n
    - Pooly.Spawn() can now update the spawned clone\u2019s localScale after spawning
    (if a V3 for scale is passed as a parameter)\r\n - Numerous optimizations under
    the hood to improve overall performance and reduce garbage collection (GC)\r\n
    - Fix for the singleton bug coming from v1.x of the asset\r\n \r\nPooly Spawner\r\n
    - Added SpawnNextAndGetReference() methods that spawn the next clone in the spawn
    cycle and return a reference to it\r\n - When spawning at a target transform,
    it is now possible have the spawned clone\u2019s rotation and/or scale match those
    of the target. There is also the option to reparent the clone under the target\r\n
    - Added the StartSpawnWithDelay() that can be used to start a delayed spawn cycle
    from a UnityEvent in the Inspector\r\n - Optimized the usage of WaitForSeconds
    to reduce GC from coroutines\r\n - Other small improvements\r\n \r\nPooly Despawner\r\n
    - Optimized the usage of WaitForSeconds to reduce GC from coroutines\r\n \r\nPlayMaker\r\n
    - Added actions for PoolySpawner\r\n - Updated PoolySpawnByName and PoolySpawnByTransform
    to allow spawning at the location of a target GameObject\r\n - Updated PoolySpawnByName
    and PoolySpawnByTransform to include the scale for the spawned clone"
